# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management knowledge base. This README summarizes our project management processes, highlights core workflows, roles, and communication strategies, and links to all supporting documentation for quick onboarding, knowledge sharing, and repeatable execution.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme uses a clearly defined lifecycle — **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release**, and **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — for all product, feature, and service projects:

- **Initiation**: Validate the business need, define success, identify stakeholders, and document the plan using a Project One-pager.
- **Planning**: Transform goals into a prioritized backlog with a defined Definition of Done, estimate effort, identify risks/dependencies, and produce a milestone-based release plan and Risk Register.
- **Execution**: Operate through iteratively managed work on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), with all changes driven by small, issue-linked pull requests, enforced CI, and required peer review.
- **Release**: Follow strict checklists for deploys, run automated and manual QA, and ensure incident/rollback readiness.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: After each milestone or incident, teams record lessons learned and track follow-up action items for ongoing refinement.

**Roles** are clear and accountable:
- *Project Managers*: Own schedules, risk, communication, process delivery.
- *Product Managers*: Drive the "what/why," prioritize outcomes, validate through data.
- *Developers*: Build, test, estimate, and help manage technical risks.
- *QA/Testing*: Verify acceptance and quality, support manual and automated QA.
- *Stakeholders*: Give feedback, input, and approvals at key stages.

**Communication** is regular and structured:
- Daily standups, weekly syncs, sprint demos/reviews, monthly stakeholder updates.
- Use of reporting templates for status, incidents, and escalation of blockers.

**Quality assurance** practices are embedded:
- Every change must pass automated tests, linting, and security scans (CI).
- Releases require pre-defined test coverage, smoke tests, and clear release notes.
- Risks are logged and reviewed; incident playbooks and retrospectives ensure that processes and quality continually improve.
